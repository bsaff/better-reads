    <book_description><![CDATA[The Armenian-Greek spiritual teacher, G.I. Gurdjieff's autobiographical account of his youth and early travels has become something of a legend since it was first published in 1963. A compulsive read in the tradition of adventure narratives, but suffused with Gurdjieff's unique perspective on life, it is organized around portraits of remarkable men and women who aided Gurdjieff's search for hidden knowledge or accompanied him on his journeys in remote parts of the Near East and Central Asia. A classic work, suffused with a haunting sense of what it means to live fully - with conscience, with purpose and with heart.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The beloved and award-winning author of BLACK HOLE's haunting and visually arresting story of an artist's obsessions, and the value and cost of pushing the boundaries of creativity</b><br /><br />As a child, Brian and his friend Jimmy would make sci-fi films in their yards, convincing their friends to star as victims of grisly murders, smearing lipstick on the "bodies" to simulate blood. Now a talented artist and aspiring filmmaker, Brian, along with Jimmy, Jimmy's friend Tina, and Laurie—his reluctant muse—sets off to a remote cabin in the woods with an old 8 millimeter camera to make a true sci-fi horror movie, an homage to Brian's favorite movie: Invasion of the Body Snatchers. But as Brian's affections for Laurie go seemingly unreciprocated, Brian writes and draws himself into a fantasy where she is the girl of his dreams, his damsel in distress, and his savior wrapped into one. Rife with references to classic sci-fi and horror movies and filled with panels of stunning depictions of nature, film and the surreal, Burns blurs the line between Brian's dreams and reality, imagination and perception. A master of the form at his finest, Final Cut is an astonishing look at what it means to truly express oneself through art.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA['I have tried to write my life as if I were confessing to a priest, a philosopher, and a wise old woman. I have tried to write as if I were going to be executed when it was finished. I have tried to write it as if I were both God and Devil.' One is tempted to say only John Cowper Powys could have written that, and, beyond doubt, only John Cowper Powys could have written the idiosyncratic and spellbinding work we have here. Yes, he was influenced by Yeats and Rousseau, especially the latter's Confessions, but there is no other work quite like this. It seems almost too pedestrian to say it covers the first sixty years of his life (he lived for another thirty years) and to say anything about them, as J. B. Priestley memorably put it, 'would be like turning on a tap before introducing people to Niagara Falls.' J. B. Priestley also said 'It is a book which can be read, with pleasure and profit, over and over again. It is in fact one of the greatest autobiographies in the English language. Even if Powys had never written any novels, this one book alone would have proved him to be a writer of genius.']]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[One of the best books I've read in my entire life. And yet not for everyone. Not at all. I read this because of Henry Miller recommending it in an interview from long ago. Powys is a fantastic expressive and wanton writer. It's by no means a chronology of his life as you might expect, it's loosely structured and dwells on the minutia of his life, nothing too small to savor and sing about. There are many spiritual and bold new age ideas deeply threaded through the text as well as an impressively honest and reflective psychological analysis of himself. A humble man, a loving man, a very eccentric man. After reading his honest writing about his life, so much of it dedicated to his love of his friends and family and literary heros, I can't help but love him too, across time.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[There is a lifeform so strange and wondrous that it forces us to rethink how life works…<br /><b></b><br />Neither plant nor animal, it is found throughout the earth, the air and our bodies. It can be microscopic, yet also accounts for the largest organisms ever recorded, living for millennia and weighing tens of thousands of tonnes. Its ability to digest rock enabled the first life on land, it can survive unprotected in space, and thrives amidst nuclear radiation.<br /><br />In this captivating adventure, Merlin Sheldrake explores the spectacular and neglected world of fungi: endlessly surprising organisms that sustain nearly all living systems. They can solve problems without a brain, stretching traditional definitions of ‘intelligence’, and can manipulate animal behaviour with devastating precision. In giving us bread, alcohol and life-saving medicines, fungi have shaped human history, and their psychedelic properties, which have influenced societies since antiquity, have recently been shown to alleviate a number of mental illnesses. The ability of fungi to digest plastic, explosives, pesticides and crude oil is being harnessed in break-through technologies, and the discovery that they connect plants in underground networks, the ‘Wood Wide Web’, is transforming the way we understand ecosystems. Yet they live their lives largely out of sight, and over ninety percent of their species remain undocumented.<br /><br /><i>Entangled Life</i> is a mind-altering journey into this hidden kingdom of life, and shows that fungi are key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel and behave. The more we learn about fungi, the less makes sense without them.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A study of interiority and inferiority, written in the vein of Lars Iyer and Ben Marcus, that takes place over the course of a single, snowy night<br /><br />After resigning from an adjunct teaching position, our narrator Sebastian Castillo, who shares a name with our author, Sebastian Castillo, and also with a translated Spanish writer, Sebastián Castillo, resolves to spend an entire year without speaking, passing the time by exercising each day and watching self-improvement videos.<br /><br />But, come New Year’s Eve, Sebastian (the narrator)—whose rich interiority in precontemplation alone is curiously and addictively easy to read—will break his silence by accepting an invitation to the home of a former professor for a reunion amongst his cohort, one decade after graduating. This invitation surely would have been ignored if not for the promised attendance of Maria, Sebastian’s former classmate and love interest. What follows is an inexplicable series of fascinating events charting the erosion of young, male hope.<br /><br />Inside a world with a peripheral understanding of Rilke, Descartes, Kant, Deleuze, Derrida, Lacan, and more, Castillo has written a short epic that is curiously addictive and unexpectedly delightful. FRESH, GREEN LIFE is a meditation on literature, academia, and philosophy; a trek through the past that forecasts a mediocre future; and a compact miracle of the fake-real.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[I've heard it said that readers and writers turn to literature because of a basic dissatisfaction with reality. I felt that dissatisfaction all through FGL, which takes place mostly inside the narrator’s head. But the book offers no better alternative to our current reality. For all his intellect and vocabulary, the narrator is just as lost as the people he criticizes. It’s a book that could only be written in a time when everyone is without a compass.<br /><br />It's a novel of disillusionment: romantic and intellectual ideals are eroded by awkward social media micro-interactions and the churning degree-for-debt machine of academia. The intellectuals referenced aren’t all-knowing heroes to be worshipped, just mere curiosities to be shared with a friend. And there's a perfect image for this intellectual disillusionment: the house of dying philosophy professor with a fridge full of books and nothing to eat—a symbol of the utility of a liberal arts degree in an economy where art is valued inversely to rent. <br /><br />One line I especially liked comes from a professor who tells his students “Say more” whenever they make an asinine point, a polite mask for his disdain. The narrator reflects that the length of someone’s speech is often inversely proportional to its substance. "There's always more to say," the narrator says, and with this, I think Castillo is pointing to our penchant for babbling, our attempts to dress up our restless talk as serious discourse. Really, we are just nervously chit-chatting. I think the real guts of life are rather simple and its been recorded well already.<br /><br />Luckily this book is also funny: The narrator’s out-of-place literary voice describing modern life emphasizes the absurdity of it and you can't help but grin. It reminded me of that Instagram comic where aliens describe human behavior in their limited English which results in novel phrases that make everything looks strange and funny again; Castillo does the same. <br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is on the subway, where after a disappointing day, the narrator rips apart a book by a YouTube-intellectual (in my head, Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules for Life) while its interrupted reader looks on in horror and fear. Hell of a way to start a new year.<br /><br />On a final note, I heard recently that after postmodernism is metamodernism, which describes this moment where we reckon with the idea that truth is more evasive than we thought. It's an age of uncertainty, where truth is either dismantled or disregarded. The feeling is that no one has the answers now. FGL is a book that fits snuggly into that ethos: its a soundtrack to an absurd moment in time, with a narrator trying to tread water in a sea of his fellow, drowning fools.<br /><br />On a final final note, this book was entertaining and brought me joy.

    <book_description><![CDATA[While on a writer’s residency, a nameless narrator focuses on the color white to creatively channel her inner pain. Through lyrical, interconnected stories, she grapples with the tragedy that has haunted her family, attempting to make sense of her older sister’s death using the color white. From trying to imagine her mother’s first time producing breast milk to watching the snow fall and meditating on the impermanence of life, she weaves a poignant, heartfelt story of the omnipresence of grief and the ways we perceive the world around us.<br /> <br />In captivating, starkly beautiful language, <i>The White Book</i> offers a multilayered exploration of color and its absence, of the tenacity and fragility of the human spirit, and of our attempts to graft new life from the ashes of destruction.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Confessions </i>is a remarkable account of the pleasures and pains of worshipping at the 'Church of Opium'. Thomas De Quincey consumed daily large quantities of laudanum (at the time a legal painkiller), and this autobiography of addiction hauntingly describes his surreal visions and hallucinatory nocturnal wanderings through London, along with the nightmares, despair and paranoia to which he became prey. The result is a work in which the effects of drugs and the nature of dreams, memory and imagination are seamlessly interwoven, describing in intimate detail the mind-altering pleasures and pains unique to opium. <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i> forged a link between artistic self-expression and addiction, paving the way for later generations of literary addicts from Baudelaire to James Frey, and anticipating psychoanalysis with its insights into the subconscious.<br /><br />This edition is based on the original serial version of 1821, and reproduces two 'sequels', 'Suspiria de Profundis' (1845) and 'The English Mail-Coach' (1849). It also includes a critical introduction discussing the romantic figure of the addict and the tradition of confessional literature, and an appendix on opium in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Thomas De Quincey (1785-1859) studied at Oxford, failing to take his degree but discovering opium. He later met Coleridge, Southey and the Wordsworths. From 1828 until his death he lived in Edinburgh and made his living from journalism.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>, you might like William S. Burroughs' <i>Junky</i>, available in Penguin Modern Classics.<br /><br />'De Quincey was one of the first great autobiographers'<br />Jonathan Bate]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The first comprehensive, objective biography of Henry Miller, one of the major literary figures of the 20th century. Drawing on Miller's vast correspondence as well as interviews with friends and associates, Mary Dearborn takes a fresh and objective look at the writer as she evaluates his achievements and his many lesser works and provides penetrating critical insight into his attitudes and philosophy.<br /><br />Lover, luster, painter, domineering husband, encyclopedia salesman, voyeur, massive egotist, self-proclaimed holy man, autocrat, iconoclast--Henry Miller's disparate selves are not readily reconciled. In this revelatory, incisive biography, his real life turns out to be even more fascinating than the fictionalized autobiographies he wove about himself. With a mixture of critical detachment and sympathy, Dearborn ( Love in the Promised Land ) explores a man of contradictions. A romantic Don Juan, Miller (1891-1980) was also a misogynist who married five times. A pacifist anarchist, he advocated violence and espoused a Nietzschean apocalyptic politics in the 1930s. Until World War II he harbored a strong anti-Semitic streak, although the great obsessional love of his life, second wife June Manfield (nee Juliet Edith Smerth) was Jewish. In Paris, penniless but rejuvenated at age 39, Miller learned how to write by making his own suffering and rebirth the subject of his art. The theme of his best books is not sex, Dearborn suggestively argues, but personal and artistic survival.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[An engaging reassessment of the celebrated essayist and his relevance to contemporary readers<br /><br />More than two centuries after his birth, Ralph Waldo Emerson remains one of the presiding spirits in American culture. Yet his reputation as the starry-eyed prophet of self-reliance has obscured a much more complicated figure who spent a lifetime wrestling with injustice, philosophy, art, desire, and suffering. James Marcus introduces readers to this Emerson, a writer of self-interrogating genius whose visionary flights are always grounded in Yankee shrewdness.<br /><br />This Emerson is a rebel. He is also a lover, a friend, a husband, and a father. Having declared his great topic to be “the infinitude of the private man,” he is nonetheless an intensely social being who develops Transcendentalism in the company of Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Bronson Alcott, and Theodore Parker. And although he resists political activism early on—hoping instead for a revolution in consciousness—the burning issue of slavery ultimately transforms him from cloistered metaphysician to fiery abolitionist.<br /><br />Drawing on telling episodes from Emerson’s life alongside landmark essays like “Self-Reliance,” “Experience,” and “Circles,” Glad to the Brink of Fear reveals how Emerson shares our preoccupations with fate and freedom, race and inequality, love and grief. It shows, too, how his desire to see the world afresh, rather than accepting the consensus view, is a lesson that never grows old.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>The Stairway to the Sun &amp; Dance of the Comets</i> brings together two short books, originally published in 1903, by the antierotic godfather of German science fiction, Paul Scheerbart. <i>The Stairway to the Sun</i> contains four fairy tales of sun, sea, animals and storm, each set in a different, fantastical locale, from the giant palace of an astral star to a dwarf's underwater glass lair in the jellyfish kingdom. Scheerbart's sad, whimsical tales provide gentle though unexpected morals that outline his work as a whole: treat animals as one would treat oneself, mutual admiration will never lead to harm and if one is able to remember that the world is grand, one will never be sad.<br /><br /><i>Dance of the Comets</i>, though published as an -Astral Pantomime, - was originally conceived as a scenario for a ballet, which Richard Strauss had planned to score in 1900 (and which Mahler accepted for the Vienna Opera). Though the project was never realized, Scheerbart's written choreography of dance, gesture, costume, feather dusters, violet moon hair and a variety of stars and planets outlines a sequence of events in which everyone--enthusiastic maid, temperamental king, indifferent executioner, foolish poet--seeks, joins and, in some cases, becomes a celestial body: a staging of Scheerbart's lifelong yearning for a home in the universe.<br /><b>Paul Scheerbart</b> (1863-1915) was a novelist, playwright, poet, critic, draftsman, visionary, proponent of glass architecture and would-be inventor of perpetual motion.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In English translation for the first time, this is "the most authoritative scripture" regarding how the Dharma was planted in Tibet, according to His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Titles in the original Tibetan "The Sanglingma Life Story," it was recorded by the dakini Yeshe Tsogyal, concealed in the ninth century at Sanglingma (Copper Temple) in Samye, and revealed by Nyang Ral Nyima Oser in the twelfth century. In addition to narrating the legendary story of a unique spiritual personality, the book contains oral instructions and advice that he left for the benefit of future generations. Also included are "A Clarification of the Life of Padmasambhava" by Tsele Natsok Rangdröl, an extensive glossary and index, and a bibliography of Tibetan and English sources.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[First published in French in 1983, <i>The Cathedral of Mist</i> is a collection of stories from the last of the great Francophone Belgian fantasists: distilled tales of distant journeys, buried memories and impossible architecture. Described here are the emotionally disturbed architectural plan for a palace of emptiness; the experience of snowfall in a bed in the middle of a Finnish forest; the memory chambers that fuel the marvelous futility of the endeavor to write; the beautiful woodland church, built of warm air currents and fog, scattering in storms and taking renewed shape at dusk, that gives this book its title. <i>The Cathedral of Mist</i> offers the sort of ethereal narratives that might have come from the pen of a sorrowful, distinctly Belgian Italo Calvino. It is accompanied by two meditative essays on reading and writing that fall in the tradition of Marcel Proust and Julien Gracq. <br /><b>Paul Willems</b> (1912-97) published his first novel, <i>Everything Here Is Real</i>, in 1941. Three more novels and, toward the end of his life, two collections of short stories bracketed his career as a playwright.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Bache couragously shares his adventures in the sprawling Infinity of the Universe. His own consciousness is his spaceship, LSD is the rocket fuel. Through detailed recollections of 70 tightly controlled trips over two decades, Chris shares his experiences and insights. The ideas are often come from his firsthand experiences of the spiritual concepts that humans have had for millenia: Each human life is part of the underlying creative, benevolent consciousness which has given birth to the cosmos, and cares for its creations deeply. Love is part of every physics equation, our universe is saturated with it. Our job throughout our lifetime on earth is to align ourselves with the Universe, our Creator, to study its powers of creativity and love and exercise them in our own lives. I feel firm in this conviction and yet still recognize the grand and unfathomable complexity of this world we find ourselves in. There is so much we have to learn, and Bache, one human cannot possibly provide all answers. But one thing is clear: We must love and create and push onwards into the infinite mystery of the universe. We are all in this Earth School together.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Born and raised in northern Manchuria during the colonial period of Korea, Yun Dong-ju was a poet of the utmost purity, beauty, and sincerity. His posthumously published collection of poems under the title Sky, wind, stars, and poems is one of the all-time favorites of Korean readers. Wishing not to have so much as a speck of shame toward heaven until the day I die, I suffered, even when the wind stirred the leaves. (From Foreword) In simple diction and straightforward expressions, his poems sing of his love for his people, his compassion for the poor and destitute, and his hopes for freedom and independence. These themes still resonate deep within the hearts of the Korean people. His imprisonment and eventual death in 1945 in a Japanese prison lend great poignancy to his work.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Incredible documentation of the spirit of mingei. Beauty and good design born for its relation to the needs of common people. And tradition must be honored while carried into the future. The world changes and so we must carry our values into the future, sometimes through neatly packaged concepts like "mingei", sometimes through tradition and ritual. If we get swept away by the changing world without holding true and grounded by our humanity and hardwrought wisdom of prior generations, we will find ourselves injured and out of sorts. Thus this book is a timeless work. Thank you Sori Yanagi ]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Lifecycles combines the best scientific testimonies about reincarnation with philosophically sound yet accessible arguments about its implications. Lifecycles is the first book to both describe the dynamics of rebirth and explore the ramifications of adopting a reincarnationist perspective. The book begins with a masterful synthesis of recent findings from consciousness research and near-death studies. It includes the work of such eminent therapists and scholars as Stanislav Grof and Dr. Ian Stevenson, and critically surveys the most compelling evidence for rebirth. Lifecycles emphasizes the lessons for self-awareness and spiritual growth inherent in a reincarnationist world view, showing us how we can reconnect with the order, intelligence, and beauty of the universe around us.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Real seriousness," Nicanor Parra, the antipoet of Chile, has said, rests in "the comic." And read in that light, this newest collection of his work is very serious indeed. It is an abundant offering of his signature mocking humor, subverting received conventions, and pretensions in both poetry and everyday life, public and private, ingeniously and wittily rendered into English in an antitranslation (the word is Parra's) by Liz Werner. Of the fifty-eight pieces in <em>Antipoems</em>, the first twenty-three are taken from Parra's 1985 collection, <em>Hojas de Parra</em> ("Vine Leaves" or "Leaves of Parra"), two others appeared in his <em>Paginas en Blanco</em> ("Blank Pages," 2001), while the rest come straight out of his notebooks and have never been published before, either in Spanish or English. The book itself is divided into two parts, "Antipoems" (im)proper and a selection of Parra's most recent incarnation of the antipoem, the hand-drawn images of his "Visual Artefactos."<br /><br /><br />As his anti-translator Liz Werner explains in her Introduction, Parra's scientific training infuses his work. "Viewed through the lens of antimatter," she writes, "antipoetry mirrors poetry, not as its adversary but as its perfect complement."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Jesus' Son</i>, the first collection of stories by Denis Johnson, presents a unique, hallucinatory vision of contemporary American life unmatched in power and immediacy and marks a new level of achievement for this acclaimed writer. In their intensity of perception, their neon-lit evocation of a strange world brought uncomfortably close to our own, the stories in <i>Jesus' Son</i> offer a disturbing yet eerily beautiful portrayal of American loneliness and hope.<br /><br />Contains:<br />Car Crash While Hitchhiking<br />Two Men<br />Out on Bail<br />Dundun<br />Work<br />Emergency<br />Dirty Wedding<br />The Other Man<br />Happy Hour<br />Steady Hands at Seattle General<br />Beverly Home']]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From one of America's most beloved poets, a piercing new collection reflecting on the characters and encounters that haunt us through this life and into the next<br /><br />Leading us into a city stirring with gravediggers and beggars, lovers and dogs, Charles Simic returns with a brilliant collection full of his singular wit, dark humor, and tenderheartedness. In poems that are often as spare as they are monumental, he captures the fleeting moments of modern life—peering inside pawnshop windows, brushing shoulders with strangers on the street, and walking familiar cemetery rows—to uncover all the beauty and worry hiding in plain sight.<br /><br />As the poet reflects on a lifetime’s worth of pleasure and loss, he recalls instances when he “made excuses and hurried away,” and considers the way memory always trails just behind. No Land in Sight is a testament to all we leave in our wake and, simultaneously, all we hang on the passing minutes, the evening’s stillness, and the many lives we inhabit in dim thresholds and bright mornings alike.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Following the death of a renowned and eccentric collector—the author of <em>Stuff</em>, a seminal philosophical work on the art of accumulation—the fate of the privately endowed museum he cherished falls to a peripatetic stranger who had been his fervent admirer. In his new role as caretaker of The Society for the Preservation of the Legacy of Dr. Charles Morgan, this restive man, in service to an absent master, at last finds his calling. The peculiar institution over which he presides is dedicated to the annihilation of hierarchy: peerless antiquities commune happily with the ignored, the discarded, the undervalued and the valueless. What transpires as the caretaker assumes dominion over this reliquary of voiceless objects and over its visitors is told in a manner at once obsessive and matter-of-fact, and in language both cocooning and expansive. A wry and haunting tale, <em>The Caretaker</em>, like the interplanetary crystal that is one of the museum’s treasures, is rare, glistening, and of a compacted inwardness.<br /><br />       Kafka or Shirley Jackson may come to mind, and <em>The Caretaker</em> may conjure up various genres—parables, ghost stories, locked-room mysteries—but Doon Arbus draws her phosphorescent water from no other writer’s well.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry “One of the truly imaginative writers of our time.” — Los Angles Times Book Review You never know what Charles Simic is up to until you reach the end of the line or the bottom of the paragraph. Waiting for you might be a kiss. Or a bludgeon. A smile at the absurdities of society, or a wistful, grim memory of World War II. He puns, pulls pranks. He can be jazzy and streetwise. Or cloak himself in antiquity. Charles Simic has new eyes, and in these wonderful poems and poems-in-prose he lets us see through them. ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>“True happiness is... to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future.”</i> <br />- Lucius Annaeus Seneca. <br /> <br /><i>De Vita Beata</i> or <b>On the Happy Life</b> is a dialogue written by Seneca the Younger around the year 58 AD. It was intended for his older brother Gallio, to whom Seneca also dedicated his dialogue entitled <i>De Ira</i> ('On Anger'). It is divided into 28 chapters that present the moral thoughts of Seneca at their most mature. Seneca explains that the pursuit of happiness is the pursuit of reason – reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature. <br /> <br />This new edition of <i>De Vita Beata</i> from Enhanced Media includes an introduction by William Smith and a Seneca image gallery. <br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization, and helped make us who we are.<br /><br />The Stoic writings of the philosopher Seneca offer powerful insights into the art of living, the importance of reason and morality, and continue to provide profound guidance to many through their eloquence, lucidity and timeless wisdom.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>The Maids</i> is a jewel: an astonishing complement to <i>The Makioka Sisters</i>, set in the same house, in the same turbulent decades, but among the servants as much as the masters. <i>The Maids</i> concerns all the young women who work—before, during, and after WWII—in the pampered, elegant household of the famous author Chikura Raikichi, his wife Sanko, and her younger sister. Though quite well-to-do, Raikichi has a small house: the family and the maids (usually a few, sharing a little room next to the kitchen) are on top of one another. This proximity helps to explain Raikichi’s extremely close observation of the maids and their daily lives, although his interest carries with it more than a dash of the erotic, calling to mind Tanizaki’s raciest books such as <i>Diary of a Mad Old Man</i> and <i>The Key</i>.<br /><br />In the sensualist, semi-innocent, sexist patrician Raikichi, Tanizaki offers a richly ironic self-portrait, but he presents as well a moving, nuanced chronicle of change and loss: centuries-old values and manners are vanishing, and here—in the evanescent beauty of the small gestures and intricacies of private life—we find a whole world to be mourned.  And yet, there is such vivacity and such beauty of writing that Tanizaki creates an intensely compelling epic in a kitchen full of lively girls.<br /><br /><br />Ethereally suggestive, sensational yet serious, witty but psychologically complex, <em>The Maids</em> is in many ways <em>The Makioka Sisters</em> revisited in a lighter, more comic mode.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[The Maids is a grower, not a show-er. It begins with an almost archival recounting of the different places this bourgeois Japanese family moved to and from, who was employed, where they came from, and their humdrum habits, etc.<br /><br />However, the novel quickly blossoms into something beautiful. Tanizaki devotedly chronicles the lives of various maids employed by his household around the life-altering WWII period in Japan. A feeling of warmth and admiration permeates his depictions of these women and their charming idiosyncrasies, maybe made charming only by the author's ability to see them as so. <br /><br />The Tanizaki family itself becomes a hearth around which many come and go to warm themselves during their personal journeys. There are accounts of budding romances and interesting details about how marriages were arranged back then as well.<br /><br />The most touching part for me are the final two chapters, where Tanizaki, in his failing health, becomes a soft, grandfatherly figure. Children become a bright light of joy to him, and the community of people comprising his family seem to be his primary focus in his final reflections on his life.<br /><br />Capturing life as it is, with very little flourish, when done with acute and caring attention, results in something undeniable.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The noted inventor and futurist’s successor to his landmark book <i> The Singularity Is Near </i> explores how technology will transform the human race in the decades to come</b><br /><br />Since it was first published in 2005, Ray Kurzweil’s <i>The Singularity Is Near </i> and its vision of an exponential future have spawned a worldwide movement. Kurzweil's predictions about technological advancements have largely come true, with concepts like AI, intelligent machines, and biotechnology now widely familiar to the public.<br /><br />In this entirely new book Ray Kurzweil brings a fresh perspective to advances toward the Singularity—assessing his 1999 prediction that AI will reach human level intelligence by 2029 and examining the exponential growth of technology—that, in the near future, will expand human intelligence a millionfold and change human life forever. Among the topics he discusses are rebuilding the world, atom by atom with devices like nanobots; radical life extension beyond the current age limit of 120; reinventing intelligence by connecting our brains to the cloud; how exponential technologies are propelling innovation forward in all industries and improving all aspects of our well-being such as declining poverty and violence; and the growth of renewable energy and 3-D printing. He also considers the potential perils of biotechnology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence, including such topics of current controversy as how AI will impact employment and the safety of autonomous cars, and "After Life" technology, which aims to virtually revive deceased individuals through a combination of their data and DNA.<br /><br />The culmination of six decades of research on artificial intelligence, <i> The Singularity Is Nearer </i> is Ray Kurzweil’s crowning contribution to the story of this science and the revolution that is to come.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Young author Aki Fujino appeared poised to making it big in the world of publishing. Her debut title UTSUBORA was being pitched about to a number of editors and at least one person felt it was set to propel her into stardom. However, before she could ever have her book published, the young woman was found dead. Some believe it was a suicide, but those close to her feel there is something more sinister involved in this young talent's death. <br />Aki's death has become something straight out of a mystery. Much like the story behind UTSUBORA, there is something more to Aki, Sakura and their relationship with an author named Mizorogi than meets the eye. And it is possible that the only way to solve this mystery may be to uncover all their secrets.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The prose poems of the great French Symbolist, Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891), have acquired enormous prestige among readers everywhere and have been a revolutionary influence on poetry in the twentieth century. They are offered here both in their original texts and in superb English translations by Louise Varèse. Mrs. Varèse first published her versions of Rimbaud’s Illuminations in 1946. Since then she has revised her work and has included two poems which in the interim have been reclassified as part of Illuminations. This edition also contains two other series of prose poems, which include two poems only recently discovered in France, together with an introduction in which Miss Varèse discusses the complicated ins and outs of Rimbaldien scholarship and the special qualities of Rimbaud’s writing. Rimbaud was indeed the most astonishing of French geniuses. Fired in childhood with an ambition to write, he gave up poetry before he was twenty-one. Yet he had already produced some of the finest examples of French verse. He is best known for A Season in Hell, but his other prose poems are no less remarkable. While he was working on them he spoke of his interest in hallucinations––"des vertiges, des silences, des nuits." These perceptions were caught by the poet in a beam of pellucid, and strangely active language which still lights up––now here, now there––unexplored aspects of experience and thought.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Stefan Sagmeister’s newest project encourages long-term thinking and reminds us that many things in the world are improving. <br /><br />Initially conceived in 2020 as the world entered pandemic lockdown, Stefan Sagmeister has created a book that looks at the state of the world today, illuminating, through collected data, how far we’ve come, and encouraging us to think about where we can go from here. Statistics are vividly brought to life, as numbers are transformed into graphs, inlaid into nineteenth-century paintings, embroidered canvases, lenticular prints, and hand-painted water glasses. <br /><br />The book includes a foreword from psychologist and leading authority on language and the mind, Steven Pinker; a featured essay by graphic designer and historian Steven Heller; and a conversation between Sagmeister and Hans Ulrich Obrist, curator and artistic director of Serpentine Galleries in London and will appeal to all visually minded readers, providing a positive reaction to the tumultuous news cycle of recent years.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[With his debut novel, Samedi the Deafness , Jesse Ball emerged as one of our most extraordinary new writers. Now, Ball returns with this haunting tale of love and storytelling, hope and identity.<br /><br />When Selah Morse sees a young woman get hit by a speeding taxicab, he rushes her to the hospital. The girl has lost her memory; she is delirious and has no identification, so Selah poses as her boyfriend. She is released into his care, but the doctor charges him to keep her awake, and to help her remember her past. Through the long night, he tells her stories, inventing and inventing, trying to get closer to what might be true, and hoping she will recognize herself in one of his tales. Offering up moments of pure insight and unexpected, exuberant humor, The Way Through Doors demonstrates Jesse Ball's great artistry and gift for and narrative.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Alternate cover edition of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214438480-supercommunicators" rel="nofollow noopener">ISBN 9780593243916</a>.</i><br /><br />Who and what are supercommunicators? They're the people who can steer a conversation to a successful conclusion. They are able to talk about difficult topics without giving offence. They know how to make others feel at ease and share what they think. They're brilliant facilitators and decision-guiders. How do they do it?<br /><br />In this groundbreaking book, Charles Duhigg unravels the secrets of the supercommunicators to reveal the art - and the science - of successful communication. He unpicks the different types of everyday conversation and pinpoints why some go smoothly while others swiftly fall apart. He reveals the conversational questions and gambits that bring people together. And he shows how even the most tricky of encounters can be turned around. In the process, he shows why a CIA operative was able to win over a reluctant spy, how a member of a jury got his fellow jurors to view an open-and-shut case differently, and what a doctor found they needed to do to engage with a vaccine sceptic.<br /><br />Above all, he reveals the techniques we can all master to successfully connect with others, however tricky the circumstances. Packed with fascinating case studies and drawing on cutting-edge research, this book will change the way you think about what you say, and how you say it.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[While the history books are filled with tales of obsessive, visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, I’ve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.” – from the Prologue<br /><br />Many of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.<br /><br /><i>The Ego is the Enemy</i> draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.<br /><br />But why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion? Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Monica</i> is a series of interconnected narratives that collectively tell the life story—actually, stories—of its title character. Clowes calls upon a lifetime of inspiration to create the most complex and personal graphic novel of his distinguished career. Rich with visual detail, an impeccable ear for language and dialogue, and thrilling twists, <i>Monica</i> is a multilayered masterpiece in comics form that alludes to many of the genres that have defined the medium—war, romance, horror, crime, the supernatural, etc.—but in a mysterious, uncategorizable, and quintessentially Clowesian way that rewards multiple readings. <br /><br />Five years in the making, <i>Monica</i> marks the apex of creativity from one of the defining voices of the graphic novel boom over the past quarter-century. A new book from Clowes is always a huge event in comics and literary circles; <i>Monica</i> will be the biggest literary event of 2023.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In a small unnamed town in the American South, a church congregation arrives to a service and finds a figure asleep on a pew. The person is genderless, racially ambiguous, and refuses to speak. One family takes the strange visitor in and nicknames them Pew.<br /><br />As the town spends the week preparing for a mysterious Forgiveness Festival, Pew is shuttled from one household to the next. The earnest and seemingly well-meaning townspeople see conflicting identities in Pew, and many confess their fears and secrets to them in one-sided conversations. Pew listens and observes while experiencing brief flashes of past lives or clues about their origins. As days pass, the void around Pew’s presence begins to unnerve the community, whose generosity erodes into menace and suspicion. Yet by the time Pew’s story reaches a shattering and unsettling climax at the Forgiveness Festival, the secret of their true nature—as a devil or an angel or something else entirely—is dwarfed by even larger truths.<br /><br /><i>Pew</i>, Catherine Lacey’s third novel, is a foreboding, provocative, and amorphous fable about the world today: its contradictions, its flimsy morality, and the limits of judging others based on their appearance. With precision and restraint, one of our most beloved and boundary-pushing writers holds up a mirror to her characters’ true selves, revealing something about forgiveness, perception, and the faulty tools society uses to categorize human complexity.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.”<br /><br /> An instant bestseller, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. <br /><br /> Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>It's Christmas time and Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from yet another school...</b><br /><br />Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels, wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and cut down by erstwhile girlfriends. The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning.<br /><br /><i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind.<br /><br /><b>

</b> (1919–2010) classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on <i>Time</i>'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>In <i>The World of Sex</i>, Henry Miller, one of the most scandalous writers of the 20th century explains his literary project <br /><br /></b>Henry Miller's bold, explicit novels scandalized readers and remade the literature of his day. In this uncompromising literary manifesto he argues that sex is at the heart of his writing because it is at the heart of life - a vital force as essential as bread, money, work or play. Drawing on his own experiences and on the writing of his famously banned novels in Paris, he shows sex as a mysterious realm that must be explored if we are to be truly free.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Anime master Hayao Miyazaki’s favorite childhood book, in English for the first time.</b><br /> <br />First published in 1937, Genzaburō Yoshino’s <i>How Do You Live?</i> has long been acknowledged in Japan as a crossover classic for young readers. Academy Award–winning animator Hayao Miyazaki (<i>Spirited Away</i>, <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i>, <i>Howl’s Moving Castle</i>) has called it his favorite childhood book and announced plans to emerge from retirement to make it the basis of a final film. <br /> <br /><i>How Do You Live?</i> is narrated in two voices. The first belongs to Copper, fifteen, who after the death of his father must confront inevitable and enormous change, including his own betrayal of his best friend. In between episodes of Copper’s emerging story, his uncle writes to him in a journal, sharing knowledge and offering advice on life’s big questions as Copper begins to encounter them. Over the course of the story, Copper, like his namesake Copernicus, looks to the stars, and uses his discoveries about the heavens, earth, and human nature to answer the question of how he will live.<br /> <br />This first-ever English-language translation of a Japanese classic about finding one’s place in a world both infinitely large and unimaginably small is perfect for readers of philosophical fiction like <i>The Alchemist</i> and <i>The Little Prince</i>, as well as Miyazaki fans eager to understand one of his most important influences.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed novel. She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Dubbed by the Japanese as "the 21st Century's Dandy," Inagaki Taruho writes short and incredibly concentrated stories of his favorite machines, airplanes, modern fairies, Saturn, falling stars, the tin moon, geometrical shapes, boys, policemen, aromatic Turkish cigarettes, black cats who turn into smoke, crashing comets, gay bars, and numerous other subjects which run throughout his tales. Writing from the 1920s to the 1970s, Inagaki is a true original, seen by many Japanese as the equal in talent of Tanizaki, Kawabata, and Mishima, and as one of the great Japanese writers of the 20th century.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The post-war period in Japan was one of immense social change as Japanese society adjusted to the shock of defeat and to the occupation of Japan by American forces and their allies. Osamu Dazai’s The Setting Sun takes this milieu as its background to tell the story of the decline of a minor aristocratic family.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of Kazuko, the unmarried daughter of a widowed aristocrat. Her search for self meaning in a society devoid of use for her forms the crux of Dazai’s novel. It is a sad story, and structurally is a novel very much within the confines of the Japanese take on the novel in a way reminiscent of authors such as Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata – the social interactions are peripheral and understated, nuances must be drawn, and for readers more used to Western novelistic forms this comes across as being rather wishy-washy.<br /><br />Kazuko’s mother falls ill, and due to their financial circumstances they are forced to take a cottage in the countryside. Her brother, who became addicted to opium during the war is missing. When he returns, Kazuko attempts to form a liaison with the novelist Uehara. This romantic displacement only furthers to deepen her alienation from society.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Flew through this one a single sit and felt by the end that I'd woken from a dream. I'm left thinking about all the things we do to ward off boredom / stay sane. Working, clowning, drinking, writing. Creativity is a basic survival mechanism. Society is just one manifestation of our creative habit and for someone to be trapped by its parameters can be an absurd tragedy.<br /><br />Some specific things I enjoyed:<br />- The mention of streets as "a mere loading screen" between home and work. <br />- The author's thoughts on how people listen to each other and how it often seems that one could reach into the deepest depths of their soul to express something true about themselves and it would have about the same impact on the listener as mentioning the weather – I've definitely felt this way.<br />- The interactions between the poet narrator and his parents, found it to be the funniest part of the book.<br />- A life-changing tip to free oneself of insomnia.]]></user_review>

                                      review: <br/>Flew through this one a single sit and felt by the end that I'd woken from a dream. I'm left thinking about all the things we do to ward off boredom / stay sane. Working, clowning, drinking, writing. Creativity is a basic survival mechanism. Society is just one manifestation of our creative habit and for someone to be trapped by its parameters can be an absurd tragedy.<br /><br />Some specific things I enjoyed:<br />- The mention of streets as "a mere loading screen" between home and work. <br />- The author's thoughts on how people listen to each other and how it often seems that one could reach into the deepest depths of their soul to express something true about themselves and it would have about the same impact on the listener as mentioning the weather – I've definitely felt this way.<br />- The interactions between the poet narrator and his parents, found it to be the funniest part of the book.<br />- A life-changing tip to free oneself of insomnia.<br/>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this imaginative hybrid of fiction? poetry? autobiography? we are brought into the mind of Sebastian, who narrates a continual stream of thoughts, dreams, regrets, and memories. As the book progresses, a larger picture comes into focus. It's a stunning cumulative effect-strange, funny, and moving. In <i>Not I</i>, we miraculously get it all: a gleeful dismantling of literary expectation, a story of a life, and a dive into the mind of an artist in the world.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />A groundbreaking work as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark, <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out.<br /><br />Includes bonus features: a meet with Neil Gaiman, a reading group guide, and an interview with Gaiman.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The New York Times bestseller from the Grammy-nominated indie rockstar Japanese Breakfast, an unflinching, deeply moving memoir about growing up mixed-race, Korean food, losing her Korean mother, and forging her own identity in the wake of her loss.<br /><br />In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humour and heart, she tells of growing up the only Asian-American kid at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother’s particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother’s tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the east coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, performing gigs with her fledgling band – and meeting the man who would become her husband – her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live.<br /><br />It was her mother’s diagnosis of terminal pancreatic cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.<br /><br />Vivacious, lyrical and honest, Michelle Zauner’s voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The author has spent his life studying the Japanese martial art of Aikido. When looking for teachers, he asks questions about the meaning of sacrifice, the physical and mental limits that can be exceeded.<br />This is a book about passion and the cost of following your dreams. With beautiful illustrations by Kim Soung (USA) - former Disney illustrator and an intriguing cover by Kuba Krawczyk (Poland), the book brings a new quality to the message of universal importance of the relationship between teacher and student. While it describes the martial arts world, this book does ask fundamental questions for which there are no simple answers, and the value is just asking these questions.<br /><br />Dear Friends,<br />We are pleased to announce the release of the printed edition of the Kingdom of Dust, by Piotr Masztalerz Sensei.<br />This book is our manifesto. It explains where our approach to training comes from and why we are looking for students, not clients. We sell it to pay the rent, to provide free training for people in need and to grow as a community. By purchasing it, you become part of its history and help survive our dojo - the Kingdom of Dust.<br /><br /><i>"The Kingdom of Dust was published in Polish in 2018. It is a book about being an uchideshi- a full time student – about building a dojo, and about the nature of teacher-student relationships. Aikido Journal highly recommends this book and hopes you’ll enjoy this short excerpt from the work."</i><br />Aikido Journal<br /><br /><i>"Aside from Masztalerz’s fine writing and beautiful character sketches, anyone within the martial arts community who has committed to a teacher, all of whom who have feet of clay, will find this book of merit, because Chiba Kazuo and Piotr Masztalerz’s relationship is an extreme of something many, if not most, of us have gone through. And it is through the harsh light of the extreme that we can illuminate the subtler shadows of our own path."</i><br />Ellis Amdur, A Critical Engagement With Piotr Masztalerz’s THE KINGDOM OF DUST]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>A lucid translation of the well-known Taoist classic by a leading scholar-now in a Shambhala Pocket Library edition.</b> <br /><br />Written more than two thousand years ago, the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i>, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. <br /><br />Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i> teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. <br /><br />Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the <i>Tao </i>or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. <br /><br /><i><b>John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry.</b> </i><br /><br /><i>This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. <br /><br />The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman. The books in this collection distill the wisdom and heart of the work Shambhala Publications has published over 50 years into a compact format that is collectible, reader-friendly, and applicable to everyday life.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This tender and nostalgic work dates from the same period as Tropic of Cancer (1934). It is a celebration of love, art, and the Bohemian life at a time when the world was simpler and slower, and Miller an obscure, penniless young writer in Paris. Whether discussing the early days of his long friendship with Alfred Perles or his escapades at the Club Melody brothel, in Quiet Days in Clichy Miller describes a period that would shape his entire life and oeuvre.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Mine has been a life of much shame. I can't even guess myself what it must be to live the life of a human being.</i><br /><br />Plagued by a maddening anxiety, the terrible disconnect between his own concept of happiness and the joy of the rest of the world, Yozo Oba plays the clown in his dissolute life, holding up a mask for those around him as he spirals ever downward, locked arm-in-arm with death.<br /><br />Osamu Dazai’s immortal—and supposedly autobiographical—work of Japanese literature, is perfectly adapted here into a manga by Junji Ito. The imagery wrenches open the text of the novel one line at a time to sublimate Yozo’s mental landscape into something even more delicate and grotesque. This is the ultimate in art by Ito, proof that nothing can surpass the terror of the human psyche.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A collection of stories about ordinary people seeking—and failing to find—the extraordinary in their lives.<br /><br />Catherine Lacey brings her narrative mastery to Certain American States , her first collection of short stories. As with her acclaimed novels Nobody Is Ever Missing and The Answers , she gives life to a group of subtly complex, instantly memorable characters whose searches for love, struggles with grief, and tentative journeys into the minutiae of the human condition are simultaneously gripping and devastating.<br /><br />The characters in Certain American States are continually coming to terms with their place in the world, and how to adapt to that place, before change inevitably returns. A woman leaves her dead husband’s clothing on the street, only for it to reappear on the body of a stranger; a man reads his ex-wife’s short story and neurotically contemplates whether it is about him; a young woman whose Texan mother insists on moving to New York City with her has her daily attempts to get over a family tragedy interrupted by a mute stranger showing her incoherent messages on his phone. These are stories of breakups, abandonment, and strained family ties; dead brothers and distant surrogate fathers; loneliness, happenstance, starting over, and learning to let go. Lacey’s elegiac and inspired prose is at its full power in this collection, further establishing her as one of the singular literary voices of her generation.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[As a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In <i>Braiding Sweetgrass</i>, Kimmerer brings these lenses of knowledge together to show that the awakening of a wider ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings are we capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learning to give our own gifts in return.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From one of our most imaginative and inventive writers, a crystalline collection of perfectly modulated, sometimes harrowing and often hilarious investigations into the multifaceted ways in which human beings perceive each other and themselves. A couple suspects their friends think them boring; a woman resolves to see herself as nothing but then concludes she's set too high a goal; and a funeral home receives a letter rebuking it for linguistic errors. Lydia Davis once again proves in the words of the Los Angeles Times "one of the quiet giants in the world of American fiction."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>
  <b>Two teenagers, in love and insane, journey across the United States in this Bonnie and Clyde-like adventure, pursuing a warped American dream, where Elvis is still king and the corn dog is the "backbone of this great country."</b>
</b><br /><br /><i>"He told her he was a one-woman man and she was it for him. Teal said that was good because he was it for her. It and It. Both of them were It."</i><br /><br />Kody Rawlee Green is stuck in juvie. Tella "Teal Cartwheels" Carticelli is packing her bags for Rome--on the orders of her parents, who want her as far from Kody as possible. But teenage love is too strong a force for the obstacles of reality. And the highway beckons.<br /><br />Leaving their abusive pasts behind them in Jersey, Kody and Teal set off on a cross-country road trip equal parts self-destruction and self-discovery, making their way, one stolen car at a time, toward bigger, wider, bluer skies. Along the road, of course, there's time to stop at Graceland, classic diners, a fairgrounds that smells of "pony shit and kettle corn, and time for run-ins with outsize personalities like the reincarnated Grand Canyon tour guide Dead Bob and the spurious Montana rancher Bill Gold. On their heels, all the while, is Teal's brother, Neil Carticelli, who's abandoned his post in the navy to rescue the sister he left behind. But does she really need saving?<br /><br />These all too American tropes find new expression in Bud Smith's own freewheeling prose--and in Rae Buleri's original illustrations--filling <i>Teenager</i> with humor, poetry, and a joy that's palpable in every unforgettable sentence.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The summer of '28 was a vintage season for a growing boy. A summer of green apple trees, mowed lawns, and new sneakers. Of half-burnt firecrackers, of gathering dandelions, of Grandma's belly-busting dinner. It was a summer of sorrows and marvels and gold-fuzzed bees. A magical, timeless summer in the life of a twelve-year-old boy named Douglas Spaulding—remembered forever by the incomparable Ray Bradbury.<br /><br />Woven into the novel are the following short stories: Illumination, Dandelion Wine, Summer in the Air, Season of Sitting, The Happiness Machine, The Night, The Lawns of Summer, Season of Disbelief, The Last--the Very Last, The Green Machine, The Trolley, Statues, The Window, The Swan, The Whole Town's Sleeping, Goodbye Grandma, The Tarot Witch, Hotter Than Summer, Dinner at Dawn, The Magical Kitchen, Green Wine for Dreaming.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For the first time in paperback--a volume of thirty-seven diabolically inventive stories, fables, and "impossible interviews" from one of the great fantasists of the 20th century, displaying the full breadth of his vision and wit.  Written between 1943 and 1984 and masterfully translated by Tim Parks, the fictions in Numbers in the Dark display all of Calvino's dazzling whimsy and horror, exuberance of style, and a cheerful grasp of the absurdities of the human condition.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Nothing within the pages of Benjamin Niespodziany's debut, full-length collection, NO FARTHER THAN THE END OF THE STREET, happens outside the confines of a single neighborhood block. Every word inside this book takes place in the young couple's home, or on the front lawn, or in the backyard, or just down the way at a neighbor's house, but never does it stray beyond where the street ends. If you notice any of the characters tiptoeing where they don't belong, please be sure to let the author know for this is a contained space for the author and his poems to play.<br /><br />Praise for NO FARTHER THAN THE END OF THE STREET:<br /><br />“If you take a short walk at just the right time in just the right light, you can see all sorts of tiny, astonishing things. This book, NO FARTHER THAN THE END OF THE STREET, is like that. I can’t stop staring." – Daniel Handler, author of BOTTLE GROVE, and as Lemony Snicket, A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS<br /><br />"Benjamin Niespodziany shows us how poetry can live inside the Nonstop! No breaks, not a single pause; one page gets us turning to the next in this brilliant and wildly inventive book! The kind of weird home I want for all poems, where we most unexpectedly and very gratefully learn the smell of melancholy." – CAConrad, author of AMANDA PARADISE and THE BOOK OF FRANK<br /><br />"Benjamin Niespodziany’s poems are intertwined lullabies written for the Theater of the Absurd, but think of it on a lawn, where things are meant to mean, even though they don't. His book’s like a weird diorama built by Edson, Kharms, Beckett, Deren, Shrigley, and Devo where Ben gets to playfully, menacingly even, move the people around the flowers, the lawn equipment. Sweet and deadly, each poem is a little cupcake, your cupcake, for the whale." – Zachary Schomburg, author of MAMMOTHER and FJORDS VOL. 1 &amp; 2<br /><br />"Have you ever returned somewhere, somewhere you’ve been before, only to notice it is different? This object, somewhat askew, but not by much. That person, of course, their name is the same it’s always been. And it goes on like this, this noticing, this thought of noticing, &amp; it turns not into a place you've returned to, but rather a place you've never left. Have you ever done that? Don’t answer until you’ve read Niespodziany's NO FARTHER THAN THE END OF THE STREET." – Dalton Day, author of EXIT, PURSUED and SPOOKY ACTION AT A DISTANCE]]></book_description>

My copy is dogearred with favorites.<br/>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In the highly anticipated <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.<br /><br />Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i> will transform the way you think about thinking.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Harvard University’s Joseph Henrich, Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, delivers a bold, epic investigation into the development of the Western mind, global psychological diversity, and its impact on the world</b><br /><b></b><br /><b></b>Perhaps you are raised in a society that is Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. If so, you’re rather psychologically peculiar.<br /><br />Unlike much of the world today, and most people who have ever lived, WEIRD people are highly individualistic, self-obsessed, control-oriented, nonconformist, and analytical. They focus on themselves—their attributes, accomplishments, and aspirations—over their relationships and social roles. How did WEIRD populations become so psychologically distinct? What role did these psychological differences play in the industrial revolution and the global expansion of Europe during the last few centuries? Did these differences have an impact on the development of the laws, economic systems, and governments that now dominate the world?<br /><br />In <i>W.E.I.R.D. Minds</i>, Joseph Henrich draws on cutting-edge research in anthropology, psychology, economics, and evolutionary biology to explore these questions and more. He illuminates the origins and evolution of family structures, marriage, and religion, and the profound impact these cultural transformations had on human psychology. Mapping these shifts through ancient history and late antiquity, Henrich reveals that the most fundamental institutions of kinship and marriage changed dramatically under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church. It was these changes that gave rise to the WEIRD psychology that would coevolve with impersonal markets, occupational specialization, and free competition—laying the foundation for the modern world.<br /><br />Provocative and engaging in both its broad scope and its surprising details, <i>W.E.I.R.D. Minds</i> explores how culture, institutions, and psychology shape one another, and explains what this means for both our most personal sense of who we are as individuals and also the large-scale social, political, and economic forces that drive human history.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The most anticipated graphic novel of 2016: from the creator of Ghost World . Patience is a psychedelic science-fiction love story, veering with uncanny precision from violent destruction to deeply personal tenderness in a way that is both quintessentially "Clowesian"and utterly unique in the author's body of work. This 180-page, full-color original graphic novel affords Clowes the opportunity to draw some of the most exuberant and breathtaking pages of his life, and to tell his most suspenseful, surprising and affecting story yet. Full-color illustrations throughout.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[G.H., a well-to-do Rio sculptress, enters the room of her maid, which is as clear and white 'as in an insane asylum from which dangerous objects have been removed'. There she sees a cockroach - black, dusty, prehistoric - crawling out of the wardrobe and, panicking, slams the door on it. Her irresistible fascination with the dying insect provokes a spiritual crisis within, in which she questions her place in the universe and her very identity, propelling her towards an act of shocking transgression. Clarice Lispector's spare, deeply disturbing yet luminous novel transforms language into something otherworldly, and is one of her most unsettling and compelling works.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Shevek, a brilliant physicist, decides to take action. He will seek answers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have isolated his planet of anarchists from the rest of the civilized universe. To do this dangerous task will mean giving up his family and possibly his life—Shevek must make the unprecedented journey to the utopian mother planet, Urras, to challenge the complex structures of life and living, and ignite the fires of change.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Both startlingly restless and immaculately compact, <i>Manazuru</i> paints the portrait of a woman on the brink of her own memories and future. Twelve years have passed since Kei’s husband, Rei, disappeared and she was left alone with her three-year-old daughter. Her new relationship with a married man—the antithesis of Rei— has brought her life to a numbing stasis, and her relationships with her mother and daughter have spilled into routine, day after day. Kei begins making repeated trips to the seaside town of <i>Manazuru</i>, a place that jogs her memory to a moment in time she can never quite locate. Her time there by the water encompasses years of unsteady footing and a developing urgency to find something. Through a poetic style embracing the surreal and grotesque, a quiet tenderness emerges from these dark moments. <i>Manazuru</i> is a meditation on memory—a profound, precisely delineated exploration of the relationships between lovers and family members.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A work of unflinching honesty, Autoportrait is a hypnotic memoir of reflection, loss, and everyday joy from one of America’s best contemporary novelists<br /><br />Jesse Ball has produced fourteen acclaimed works of deeply empathetic absurdism in poetry and fiction. Now, he offers readers his first memoir, one that showcases his “humane curiosity” (James Wood) and invites the reader into a raw and personal account of love, grief, and memory. Inspired by the memoir Édouard Levé put to paper shortly before his death, Autoportrait is an extraordinarily frank and intimate work from one of America’s most brilliant young authors.<br /><br />The subtle power of Ball’s voice conjures the richness of everyday life. On each page, half-remembered moments are woven together with the joys and triumphs—and the mistakes and humiliations, too—that somehow tell us who we are, why we are here. Held at the same height as tragic accounts of illness or death are moments of startling beauty, banality, or humor: “I wake in the morning, I sit, I walk long distances. If there is somewhere to swim, I may swim. If I have a bicycle, I will ride it, especially to meet someone. There is no more preparing for me to do, other than preparing for death, and I do that by laughing. Not laughing at death, of course. Laughing at myself.” <br /><br />An extraordinary memoir that reminds us what is possible and builds to the kind of power one might feel reading Anne Carson’s Glass Essay, or Joe Brainard’s I Remember. Autoportrait will leave you feeling utterly invigorated, inspired, and a little afraid.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this book. It's enriched my connection with my Aikido. But what I like most about this book is that it completely transcends the topic of Aikido; it is, at the core, a human story. It is an honest and well-researched panoramic view of Kazuo Chiba's life. It hints at Sensei's own struggle through his life, a struggle which in some form or another we all go through. Aikido was his lantern in the night and he's shared it with us all. And thank you Liese Klein for endeavoring to share his life story with the world.]]></user_review>

At first Kikuji is appalled by her indelicate nature, but it is not long before he succumbs to passion—a passion with tragic and unforeseen consequences, not just for the two lovers, but also for Mrs. Ota’s daughter, to whom Kikuji’s attachments soon extend. Death, jealousy, and attraction convene around the delicate art of the tea ceremony, where every gesture is imbued with profound meaning.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[I liked this book. The part where Kikuji and Fumiko are talking about the tea cups. The characters use the tea cups as a vessel to talk about things that would otherwise be impossible in their formal and restrictive culture: the trauma passed onto them by their parents, their own present desires, and the emotional conflict that seems to hold back from moving forward with their lives. Kawabata seems especially skilled at using symbols to carry depths of meaning that wouldn't be as beautifully presented if translated directly into words.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<em>The Gentle Barbarian</em> is Bohumil Hrabal’s homage to Vladimír Boudník, one of the greatest Czech visual artists of the 1950s and 1960s, whose life came to a tragic end shortly after the Soviet invasion of 1968. Boudnik and Hrabal had a close and often contentious friendship. For a brief period, in the early 1950s, they both worked in the steel works in Kladno and lived in the same building in Prague.<br /><br />          Written in the early seventies, Hrabal’s anecdotal portrait of Boudnik includes another controversial member of that early group of the Czech avant-garde: the poet Egon Bondy. While Hrabal and Bondy were evolving their aesthetic of “total realism,” Boudnik developed his own artistic approach that he called “Explosionalism,” in which the boundaries between life and art become blurred, and everyday events take on the appearance and the substance of art.<br /><br />          Hrabal’s portrait of Boudnik captures the strange atmosphere of a time in which the traditional values and structures of everyday life in Czechoslovakia were being radically dismantled by the Communists. But as <em>The Gentle Barbarian</em> demonstrates, creative spirits are able to reject, ignore, or burrow beneath the superficial “revolutionary” atmosphere of the time, and find humor, inspiration, and a kind of salvation amidst its general intellectual and creative poverty. <br /> ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The epic novel of man and nature that won its author the Nobel Prize in Literature, in the first new English translation in more than ninety years</b><br /><br />When it was first published in 1917, <i>Growth of the Soil</i> was immediately recognized as a masterpiece. More than one-hundred years later it still remains a transporting literary experience. In the story of Isak, who leaves his village to clear a homestead and raise a family amid the untilled tracts of the Norwegian back country, Knut Hamsun evokes the elemental bond between humans and the land. Newly translated by the acclaimed Hamsun scholar Sverre Lyngstad, Hamsun's novel is a work of preternatural calm, stern beauty, and biblical power--and the crowning achievement of one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[With this new collection, George Saunders takes us even further into the shocking, uproarious and oddly familiar landscape of his imagination.<br /><br />The stories in <i>Pastoralia</i> are set in a slightly skewed version of America, where elements of contemporary life have been merged, twisted, and amplified, casting their absurdity—and our humanity—in a startling new light. Whether he writes a gothic morality tale in which a male exotic dancer is haunted by his maiden aunt from beyond the grave, or about a self-help guru who tells his followers his mission is to discover who's been "crapping in your oatmeal," Saunders's stories are both indelibly strange and vividly real.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Eccentric, adventurous Christina Goering meets the anxious but equally enterprising Mrs. Copperfield at a party. <br /><br />Two serious ladies who want to live outside of themselves, they go in search of salvation: Mrs. Copperfield visits Panama with her husband, where she finds solace among the women who live and work in its brothels; while Miss Goering becomes involved with various men. At the end the two women meet again, each changed by her experience. <br /><br />Mysterious, profound, anarchic and very funny, 'Two Serious Ladies' is a daring, original work that defies analysis.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[A strange book about two women in the 1940s going completely off script, breaking away from their mundane lives to fall into sordid circumstances with a cast of oddball characters, who pop in and out of the story inexplicably, like phases of a dream. The two women, in their separate stories, follow their every whim in a desperate hope to find some ultimate answer to the absurd question of their lives. Published in 1943, this book is in my opinion ahead of its time, and feels like it'd fit snugly in with the wild prose of Kerouac and fellow Beatniks.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From Roald Dahl, the master of the sting in the tail, a newly collected book of his darkest stories. 'The cruelest lies are often told in silence . . .' Why do we lie? Why do we deceive those we love most? What do we fear revealing? In these ten tales of deception master storyteller Roald Dahl explores our tireless efforts to hide the truth about ourselves. Here, among many others, you'll read about how to get away with the perfect murder, the old man whose wagers end in a most disturbing payment, how revenge is sweeter when it is carried out by someone else and the card sharp so good at cheating he does something surprising with his life. Dahl understood our deepest secrets, desires and fears and Deception is one of four books - the rest being Lust, Cruelty and Madness - that explore our hidden selves.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[What is a properly functioning mythology and what are its functions? Can we use myths to help relieve our modern anxiety, or do they help foster it? In <b>Myths to Live By,</b> Joseph Campbell explores the enduring power of the universal myths that influence our lives daily and examines the myth-making process from the primitive past to the immediate present, retuning always to the source from which all mythology springs: the creative imagination. Campbell stresses that the borders dividing the Earth have been shattered; that myths and religions have always followed the certain basic archetypes and are no longer exclusive to a single people, region, or religion. He shows how we must recognize their common denominators and allow this knowledge to be of use in fulfilling human potential everywhere.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From Ernest Hemingway's Preface: 'There are many kinds of stories in this book. I hope you will find some that you like- In going where you have to go, and doing what you have to do, and seeing what you have to see, you dull and blunt the instrument you write with. But I would rather have it bent and dulled and know I had to put it on the grindstone and hammer it into shape and put a whetstone to it, and know that I had something to write about, than to have it bright and shining, and nothing to say, or smooth and well-oiled in the closet, but unused.'<br /><br />A collection of Hemingway's first forty-nine short stories, featuring a brief introduction by the author and lesser known as well as familiar tales, including 'Up in Michigan', 'Fifty Grand', and 'The Light of the World', and the <i>Snows of Kilimanjaro</i>, <i>Winner Take Nothing' </i>and <i>Men Without Women</i> collections.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Commonly seen as the legendary Norwegian writer's masterpiece, this story tells the tale of Siss and Unn, two friends who have only spent one evening in each other's company. But so profound is this evening between them that when Unn inexplicably disappears, Siss's world is shattered. The Ice Palace is written in prose of a lyrical economy that ranks among the most memorable achievements of modern literature.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[When the technologies we use every day collapse our experiences into 24/7 availability, platforms for personal branding, and products to be monetized, nothing can be quite so radical as… doing nothing. Here, Jenny Odell sends up a flare from the heart of Silicon Valley, delivering an action plan to resist capitalist narratives of productivity and techno-determinism, and to become more meaningfully connected in the process.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For more than twenty years, Lemony Snicket has led millions of young readers through a mysterious world of bewildering questions and unfortunate events. With this latest book—a love letter to readers young and old about the vagaries of real life—longtime fans and new readers alike will experience Snicket’s distinctive voice in a new way.<br /><br />This true story—as true as Lemony Snicket himself—begins with a puzzling note under his door: You had poison for breakfast. Following a winding trail of clues to solve the mystery of his own demise, Snicket takes us on a thought-provoking tour of his predilections: the proper way to prepare an egg, a perplexing idea called “tzimtzum,” the sublime pleasure of swimming in open water, and much else.<br /><br /><em>Poison for Breakfast</em> is a classic-in-the-making that—in the great tradition of modern fables like <em>The Little Prince</em> and <em>The Phantom Tollbooth</em>—will delight readers of all ages.]]></book_description>

These translations illuminate one of this century's most controversial writers and have made Kafka's work accessible to a whole new generation. This classic collection of forty-one great short works -- including such timeless pieces of modern fiction as "The Judgment" and "The Stoker" -- now includes two new stories, "First Sorrow" and "The Hunger Artist."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A bestseller in France and winner of Japan’s Kiyama Shohei Literary Award, <em>The Guest Cat</em>, by the acclaimed poet Takashi Hiraide, is a subtly moving and exceptionally beautiful novel about the transient nature of life and idiosyncratic but deeply felt ways of living. A couple in their thirties live in a small rented cottage in a quiet part of Tokyo; they work at home, freelance copy-editing; they no longer have very much to say to one another. But one day a cat invites itself into their small kitchen. It leaves, but the next day comes again, and then again and again. Soon they are buying treats for the cat and enjoying talks about the animal and all its little ways. Life suddenly seems to have more promise for the husband and wife — the days have more light and color. The novel brims with new small joys and many moments of staggering poetic beauty, but then something happens….<br /><br />As Kenzaburo Oe has remarked, Takashi Hiraide’s work "really shines." His poetry, which is remarkably cross-hatched with beauty, has been acclaimed here for "its seemingly endless string of shape-shifting objects and experiences,whose splintering effect is enacted via a unique combination of speed and minutiae."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Tsukiko is drinking alone in her local sake bar when by chance she meets one of her old high school teachers and, unable to remember his name, she falls back into her old habit of calling him 'Sensei'. After this first encounter, Tsukiko and Sensei continue to meet. Together, they share edamame beans, bottles of cold beer, and a trip to the mountains to eat wild mushrooms. As their friendship deepens, Tsukiko comes to realise that the solace she has found with Sensei might be something more.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Doug is having a strange night. A weird buzzing noise on the other side of the wall has woken him up, and there, across the room, next to a huge hole torn out of the bricks, sits his beloved cat, Inky. Who died years ago. But who’s nonetheless slinking out through the hole, beckoning Doug to follow.<br /><br />What’s going on? To say any more would spoil the freaky, Burnsian fun, especially because <i>X’ed Out</i>, unlike <i>Black Hole</i>, has not been previously serialized, and every unnervingly meticulous panel will be more tantalizing than the last...]]></book_description>
