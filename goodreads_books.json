Gurdjieff's autobiographical account of his youth and early travels has become something of a legend since it was first published in 1963. A compulsive read in the tradition of adventure narratives, but suffused with Gurdjieff's unique perspective on life, it is organized around portraits of remarkable men and women who aided Gurdjieff's search for hidden knowledge or accompanied him on his journeys in remote parts of the Near East and Central Asia.

      "review": "One of the best books I've read in my entire life. And yet not for everyone. Not at all. I read this because of Henry Miller recommending it in an interview from long ago. Powys is a fantastic expressive and wanton writer. It's by no means a chronology of his life as you might expect, it's loosely structured and dwells on the minutia of his life, nothing too small to savor and sing about. There are many spiritual and bold new age ideas deeply threaded through the text as well as an impressively honest and reflective psychological analysis of himself. A humble man, a loving man, a very eccentric man. After reading his honest writing about his life, so much of it dedicated to his love of his friends and family and literary heros, I can't help but love him too, across time.",

One is tempted to say only John Cowper Powys could have written that, and, beyond doubt, only John Cowper Powys could have written the idiosyncratic and spellbinding work we have here.

      "review": "I've heard it said that readers and writers turn to literature because of a basic dissatisfaction with reality. I felt that dissatisfaction all through FGL, which takes place mostly inside the narrator’s head. But the book offers no better alternative to our current reality. For all his intellect and vocabulary, the narrator is just as lost as the people he criticizes. It’s a book that could only be written in a time when everyone is without a compass.<br /><br />It's a novel of disillusionment: romantic and intellectual ideals are eroded by awkward social media micro-interactions and the churning degree-for-debt machine of academia. The intellectuals referenced aren’t all-knowing heroes to be worshipped, just mere curiosities to be shared with a friend. And there's a perfect image for this intellectual disillusionment: the house of dying philosophy professor with a fridge full of books and nothing to eat—a symbol of the utility of a liberal arts degree in an economy where art is valued inversely to rent. <br /><br />One line I especially liked comes from a professor who tells his students “Say more” whenever they make an asinine point, a polite mask for his disdain. The narrator reflects that the length of someone’s speech is often inversely proportional to its substance. \"There's always more to say,\" the narrator says, and with this, I think Castillo is pointing to our penchant for babbling, our attempts to dress up our restless talk as serious discourse. Really, we are just nervously chit-chatting. I think the real guts of life are rather simple and its been recorded well already.<br /><br />Luckily this book is also funny: The narrator’s out-of-place literary voice describing modern life emphasizes the absurdity of it and you can't help but grin. It reminded me of that Instagram comic where aliens describe human behavior in their limited English which results in novel phrases that make everything looks strange and funny again; Castillo does the same. <br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is on the subway, where after a disappointing day, the narrator rips apart a book by a YouTube-intellectual (in my head, Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules for Life) while its interrupted reader looks on in horror and fear. Hell of a way to start a new year.<br /><br />On a final note, I heard recently that after postmodernism is metamodernism, which describes this moment where we reckon with the idea that truth is more evasive than we thought. It's an age of uncertainty, where truth is either dismantled or disregarded. The feeling is that no one has the answers now. FGL is a book that fits snuggly into that ethos: its a soundtrack to an absurd moment in time, with a narrator trying to tread water in a sea of his fellow, drowning fools.<br /><br />On a final final note, this book was entertaining and brought me joy. Thank you",

Through detailed recollections of 70 tightly controlled trips over two decades, Chris shares his experiences and insights. The ideas are often come from his firsthand experiences of the spiritual concepts that humans have had for millenia: Each human life is part of the underlying creative, benevolent consciousness which has given birth to the cosmos, and cares for its creations deeply. Love is part of every physics equation, our universe is saturated with it. Our job throughout our lifetime on earth is to align ourselves with the Universe, our Creator, to study its powers of creativity and love and exercise them in our own lives. I feel firm in this conviction and yet still recognize the grand and unfathomable complexity of this world we find ourselves in. There is so much we have to learn, and Bache, one human cannot possibly provide all answers. But one thing is clear: We must love and create and push onwards into the infinite mystery of the universe. We are all in this Earth School together.",

      "review": "The Maids is a grower, not a show-er. It begins with an almost archival recounting of the different places this bourgeois Japanese family moved to and from, who was employed, where they came from, and their humdrum habits, etc.<br /><br />However, the novel quickly blossoms into something beautiful. Tanizaki devotedly chronicles the lives of various maids employed by his household around the life-altering WWII period in Japan. A feeling of warmth and admiration permeates his depictions of these women and their charming idiosyncrasies, maybe made charming only by the author's ability to see them as so. <br /><br />The Tanizaki family itself becomes a hearth around which many come and go to warm themselves during their personal journeys. There are accounts of budding romances and interesting details about how marriages were arranged back then as well.<br /><br />The most touching part for me are the final two chapters, where Tanizaki, in his failing health, becomes a soft, grandfatherly figure. Children become a bright light of joy to him, and the community of people comprising his family seem to be his primary focus in his final reflections on his life.<br /><br />Capturing life as it is, with very little flourish, when done with acute and caring attention, results in something undeniable.",

Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from "

Society is just one manifestation of our creative habit and for someone to be trapped by its parameters can be an absurd tragedy.<br /><br />Some specific things I enjoyed:<br />- The mention of streets as \"a mere loading screen\" between home and work. <br />- The author's thoughts on how people listen to each other and how it often seems that one could reach into the deepest depths of their soul to express something true about themselves and it would have about the same impact on the listener as mentioning the weather – I've definitely felt this way.<br />- The interactions between the poet narrator and his parents, found it to be the funniest part of the book.<br />- A life-changing tip to free oneself of insomnia.",

See other reviews for details.<br /><br />And yet, having said all of this, I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy it, its (regrettably few but still) transcendental moments that tower over the muck; it often functions as a work of porn fiction; somewhere between that and a frantic adventure of late nights and sordid people in 30s Paris.<br /><br />We must allow art to be enjoyed while resisting our impulse to evaluate its morals. Or at least separate our discussions on a book's morality from its artistic merit.This is why Miller flourished in France during his time. Still today in America we are high on righteousness, in whatever new forms it takes, and are primed to judge and shoot down anything that's out of line with our beliefs. Our morals can help guide us, make it possible to live harmoniously together. But I'd argue that it's possible and sometimes necessary to put moral convictions aside temporarily to experience a work of art.<br /><br />Having said all this, I can see why any woman would hate this book and its author. The women depicted are tragically contorted shadows of what women are and have the potential to be nowadays.<br /><br />Finally, I would not recommend this as a starting point into HM. He's got better stuff (Maroussi).",
      "description": "This tender and nostalgic work dates from the same period as Tropic of Cancer (1934). It is a celebration of love, art, and the Bohemian life at a time when the world was simpler and slower, and Miller an obscure, penniless young writer in Paris. Whether discussing the early days of his long friendship with Alfred Perles or his escapades at the Club Melody brothel, in Quiet Days in Clichy Miller describes a period that would shape his entire life and oeuvre."

      "review": "I really enjoyed this book. It's enriched my connection with my Aikido. But what I like most about this book is that it completely transcends the topic of Aikido; it is, at the core, a human story. It is an honest and well-researched panoramic view of Kazuo Chiba's life. It hints at Sensei's own struggle through his life, a struggle which in some form or another we all go through. Aikido was his lantern in the night and he's shared it with us all. And thank you Liese Klein for endeavoring to share his life story with the world.",
      "description": "The Life-Giving Kazuo Chiba's Life in Aikido spans modern Japanese history and ranges across the world to tell the story of a man with a mission - to understand and transmit the modern martial art of Aikido. It's a story full of struggle and heartbreak that will leave the reader with a new appreciation of an immigrant's achievements and the transformative power of a unique physical and spiritual practice."

There's a unique and refreshing creativity in Machida's prose and it comes through in this fantastic translation by Daniel Joseph - I don't think I've felt tempted to dig into a translators other works before this.

Maybe to some extent we all do this? Being right feels better than being wrong. And it's often easier to convince yourself that you're right than to admit you're wrong. Anyway.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who thinks they are a superhuman, who looks down on others, who thinks they can optimize their bodies to the extent of not needing to poop so that when people say to them, \"You think your shit doesn't stink just like the rest of us?\" they can reply, \"I do not poop, so no.\"",

That I belonged in my skin. That my organs were mine and my ears, which could only hear the silence of this night and my faint breathing, were mine, and I loved them and what they could do. There was so much water in so many places, rushing everywhere, up and down, the water on top moving so much faster than the water below it.

I felt huge, sluggish, limitless in mass. It would take me hours to get up. I might never move again. I could become this landscape. I could fade into the pavement. I could watch as a mountain would watch, as a man without obligation. From a balcony, even twelve feet up, there was enough distance. There is movement below but it's not your movement\"<br /><br />\"The truth had to be seen. Anything else was a story, entertaining but more embroidered fib than crude, shapeless fact.\"<br /><br />\"I rested my palm on the water. The water, undulating slightly with the waves unformed, rose to kiss my palm. The water was not God. The water undulating slightly with the waves was not spiritual. It was jagged cold water, and it felt perfect when we put our hand into it and it kissed our palms again and again, would never stop kissing our palms – and why wasn't that enough?\"",

Your forehead is ten times its normal size, your nose is reduced to a pin point, and your limbs appear like wavy ribbons upon the curving surface of the mirrors. What’s disturbing about the reflection is that it still kind of looks like you—it’s a believable image.

A character conducts his entire life from the inside of a globe. These \"novels\" aren't just a experiment in imagination – they approach humanity at oblique angles and are thus uniquely revelatory and refreshing. Even the most enigmatic of the \"novels\" leave room for the reader to interact and lend their own imagination and experience to feel it out a final result.<br /><br />Highly recommend this, especially if you're into magical realism ✨",

We’ve been drinking tea for thousands of years, yet few of us realize that all tea types—from elegant lapsang to pungent pu-erh—come from the same plant. But how are there so many different styles? It comes down to science: geography, biology, chemistry, and physics; the application of heat and pressure; and the magic of time and enzymes"

In The Dawn of Tantra the reader meets a Tibetan meditation master and a Western scholar, each of whose grasp of Buddhist tantra is real and unquestionable. This collaboration is both true to the intent of the ancient Tibetan teachings and relevant to contemporary West"

The narrator conjures a t-rex to wreck his place of employment and release suffocating shits on his boss, he imagines launching into the cosmos to smash up stars with leg drops. <br /><br />The imaginative prose in this book is like a flower blooming in the middle of a junk yard - the contrast is stark, and uniquely beautiful and hopeful.<br /><br />The Bar is Low will have you laughing out loud despite yourself, and surprise you when you find a smile forming on your face where you expected to crinkle your nose.",

Someone who takes care of him unconditionally, like a loving mother would, a wife that doesn't harbor any deeper thoughts about life or have any personal desires of her own. Kaname is at peace at this realization. But I think he may be in for disillusionment. (This was written in 1928)<br /><br />Besides that distasteful conclusion...<br /><br />The theme seems to be the on the nature of old-fashioned tradition - it's not wholly good or bad, but taken with blind faith, tradition can result in irrational and oppressive hardships.<br /><br />I think Tanizaki was a believer in balancing the good of the new with the good of the old. Not neglecting one entirely for the other.",
      "description": "The marriage of Kaname and Misako is disintegrating: whilst seeking passion and fulfilment in the arms of others, they contemplate the humiliation of divorce. Misako's father believes their relationship has been damaged by the influence of a new and alien culture, and so attempts to heal the breach by educating his son-in-law in the time-honoured Japanese traditions of aesthetic and sensual pleasure. The result is an absorbing, chilling conflict between ancient and modern, young and old."

He masterfully links four fundamental human desires—sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control—with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip,"

They met a rich dude whose \"friend\" was willing to pay them good money if they wrote erotica for his personal collection. The two artists, with money being hard to come by, and themselves being of the sexually liberal Parisian spirit, said OK, fuck it.<br /><br />And so the stories of Delta Venus were born.<br /><br />This collection is fetish-filled and often times just for the sake of satisfying their proprietor's desire. But Nin also flexes her poetic talent as a writer, and it's what make this collection worth a read. <br /><br />Sometimes the stories go deeply into the psyche and history of a sexually frenzied character, revealing a complex psychology and positing sexual desire as both completely natural and completely unique from person to person. <br /><br />There are stories in here, especially the last one, in which Nin attempts to breakdown the communication barriers of the sexs, having characters spend a night exploring whatever fantasies they want and then letting them discuss openly their favorite sensations and their bodies.<br /><br />But those are the hidden gems of this collection. Overall it's main purpose is to stir the lusty imagination. But Anis Nin's skill as a writer and a poet come through nonetheless and, I think, justify this book as literature, separate and distinct from the cheap thrills of a book like 50 shades of grey.",
      "description": "Fifteen short stories by Anaïs Nin published posthumously in 1977 - though largely written in the 1940s as erotica for a private collector. <br /><br />In Delta of Venus Anaïs Nin penned a lush, magical world where the characters of her imagination possess the most universal of desires and exceptional of talents. Among these provocative stories, a Hungarian adventurer seduces wealthy women then vanishes with their money; a veiled woman selects strangers from a chic restaurant for private trysts;"

How's your 401K?\" and you say, \"I don't want a house.\" and you don't even acknowledge the second question and in the end you all cross your arms over chests and puff out a short but aggressive burst of air from your nostrils.<br /><br />This book is about generational clash and the radically changing times in mid 19th century Russia, right before serfdom was formerly abolished and all peasants set free. But I think it's a classic because it captures so well that idea of generational clash, and most importantly, that social change is a crashing wave: it's much larger than one family disagreeing amongst themselves.

Nothing too lofty or high brow, just a little meditation — I was able to take a look at what I'm pursuing, what I think will make me happier and decide whether it really would. Will getting that new job in a new state/country really make everything perfect for me? The answer is — as it will be with any material gain — \"no\". Happiness should come from something sustainable, a deeper connection and understanding of ourselves and our relation to others and the even the planet (Happy Earth Day).<br /><br />In short, this book has reminded me to:<br />- Be grateful (for eating, for breathing, for higher consciousness)<br />- Be generous (ask the question \"What can I do for others\" instead of \"What do I want for myself\")<br />- Remember that material pursuits do not lead to sustainable well-being, and should be recognized as playful, not essential",

But most striking parts to me were when Miller went deep. After 70 years in the world, Miller has plenty to say. He seems to be heavily influenced by Zen: every moment is miraculous, there's nothing to condemn, nothing to remonstrate, and there is equally no need to understand, no need to conceptualize, no need to control. He reflects on the relative progress of civilization, the ever-forward motion, and wishes we as a species were able to first learn to stay still, to find an inner contentment with our individual lives. Peace is not external but something inherent and possible within all of us. It's not in the accomplishment of most difficult tasks, but rather in the simple and the mundane.<br /><br />I've marked up this book with highlighting, underlining, asterisks. I've also accidentally spilled water on it and the cover has entirely come loose — it's safe to say this book is now thoroughly mine. It's a book I will need to come back to again when I inevitably veer of course.<br />",

      "review": "<i>The Spirit of the Bathtub</i> is a book of poems by Marcus Slease. <br /><br />These poems have a knack for painting odd scenes. You may feel a detachment from real life, especially when the poems enter into the surreal world of dream. You may suddenly, for example, find yourself taking a road trip with a squirrel viking who has a thing for hostess donuts dunked in White Russians. But even in these dreamy sequences, a bleak reality tinges the atmosphere and you know existential bummers are right around the corner. <br /><br />These poems are connected by feelings of individualism, that in its darker moments, slip into alienation. This effect is enhanced by the settings which often seem to be foreign, contrasting the speaker as the foreigner.<br /><br />The displacement of the speaker into foreign countries (South Korea, Poland, Italy) allows for a special introspective mood that may not be easily found in routine home life. Saturated by a feeling of \"otherness\", these poems reveal a poet who is trying to solidify their existence despite unfamiliar ground, uncertainty of the future, and the plain fact that life has no real objective.<br /><br />\"I am not going to win because I am not a winner and there is nothing to win and that's sad don't you think. I was told to be a winner and I don't know what that means\"<br />From SPIRIT MONKEYS<br /><br />Favorite poems:<br />- THE LIVING ARE SOFT AND YIELDING<br />- MOTH CITY<br />- BALLOONS<br />- NEW CITY<br />- EMPTINESS IS FORM<br />- SPIRIT MONKEYS<br />- NOTE ON POEM",

By understanding the characters of <i>Sons and Lovers</i>, the reader understands the conflicts that arise between them as inevitable.<br /><br />Lawerence understands and embodies himself as a restless artist named Paul Morel. He exposes the ego, the vanity, the ambition that often comes with the territory of being an artist. Paul Morel is never able to give himself fully to any other person.

The concept of this book, if it had a definitive name, might be \"How humans reason about their subjective world\". <br /><br />The book follows Mr. Palomar as he reasons and contemplates things: the patterns of the waves of the ocean, the underbelly of a gecko, CHEESE, mismatched slippers, and Death, to name a few. <br /><br />Throughout the book Mr. Palomar contemplates the world through three main lens (Calvino lists them at the end of the book): visually, socially, and cosmically. Though the book has no traditional progression of plot, it progresses nonetheless through its increasingly metaphysical observations of the world, ending with a final meditation on Death.<br /><br />My favorite times in this book are when Mr. Palomar makes simple, zen-like observations like when he describes the language of birds on his vacation home's terrace.<br /><br />More often than not Mr. Palomar strives to intellectually and objectively grasp at his reality only to end up even more mystified with his world than he was at the start.",

Most people work most of the time in order to live, and the little freedom they have left over frightens them so, that they will do anything to get rid of it. Oh, the regimentation of mankind!”<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />“[I]n this world no one easily understands another.”<br /></blockquote><br /><blockquote><br />“What I regret is that he often speaks of matters he has only heard or read about and always from the point of view that someone has presented to him.”<br /></blockquote>",

It begins by describing the ideal postures and breathing techniques for zazen, making it possible to begin practicing right away. It goes on to map out our normal pattern of consciousness and how to quiet the mind, eventually emptying it completely. Emptying the mind is important part of Zen but it is not the ultimate goal. Emptying the mind stops the regular pattern of egocentric consciousness and helps the mind perceive the world in its pure form, that is, without relation to our own experience or ego. Imagine what it would be like to see a flower for the first time. Imagine not thinking in terms of \"I\".<br /><br />This book reinforced for me the fact that my daily (seemingly lifelong) patten of consciousness can be altered and improved by reducing egocentric thoughts and increasing direct perception (pure consciousness) of the world and people around me.",

It's provides a decent high-level view of some Japanese philosophical concepts, lifestyle, and culture. and there are certainly some good suggestions for improving your lifestyle embedded in the work. but those good bits and buried between the fluff, the light lack of substance material that seems to characterize this book. one section provides excerpts from a famously long living community in Okinawa. Providing useless quotes such as \"eat and sleep and you will live a long time\", \"everything is fine\", and \"I just haven't died yet\". c'mon guys...who thought this would be beneficial for anyone. <br /><br />to be fair there's some good stuff too if you are open to it. I really like the concept of \"hara hachi bu\" - eating until you are 80% full, rather than stuffing yourself.

But this memoir doesn't connect with me. The literary, academic allusions throughout the book worked sometimes but I mostly found them superfluous. The constant psychoanalysis the author performs on her own commentary makes this thing read often like a well-written diary. That's what this book was to me. <br /><br />And I guess I wanted something a little more engaging and maybe even edifying. Being a straight young man, I didn't expect to identify directly with this story. But I can't really imagine even a young girl struggling with their own sexual identity find much benefit in reading this. It seems more of a catharsis for the author. Which is fine and good but nonetheless missed the mark for me",

Finally when his period at Benjamenta Institute ends, he decides to end his mental meanderings with it and jump into life, without pretension or particular self-worth.

      "review": "I'm still floating in that afterglow that comes with finishing a book that penetrates your entire being. My words can't really capture how I felt about this book; Miller says himself that his purpose in writing the book was not to convey knowledge to the reader but simply to convey human experience, and here too I only wish to convey how much I enjoyed the experience of reading it. It transcends a character study or a travelogue or auto-biographical account. It is a study of humanity: what it is to truly be human and an individual, to rediscover a wonder of the world that has been stripped away by modern civilization, and to critically think about what it really means to be civilized and what we value in the West. This is just scratching the surface of topics Miller spins into while recounting his travels in Greece. To say it simply, to read this book is to follow a man's intimate connection with his existence and with the world he finds himself in, to follow him in his reveries and his exhalations. I have never heard of a man so happy and simultaneously aware of the good and evil of our world. His rapture and wonder transcend the printed words and spread like a chemical catalyst into my nervous system. In finishing this book, I just want to embrace myself and embrace the world and live. <br /><br />“To be silent the whole day long, see no newspaper, hear no radio, listen to no gossip, be thoroughly and completely lazy, thoroughly and completely indifferent to the fate of the world is the finest medicine a man can give himself.”",

As an impoverished writer in need of rejuvenation, Miller travelled to Greece at the invitation of his friend, the writer Lawrence Durrell. The text is inspired by the events that occurred. The text is ostensibly a portrait of the Greek writer George Katsimbalis, although some critics have opined that is more of a self-portrait of Miller himself. Mi"

Here's why: <br /><br />This book gives incredible insight into coping with the real world. The world is not glamorous, people are not perfect and often tip towards the detestable side of the scale. And with the accumulation of knowledge and experience, the aforementioned faults of life are highlighted, like bad lighting can make your face look kinda shitty. But this book responds to that bad lighting or pessimism, if you will, in a beautiful way that only Salinger can pull off. This book is full of impeccably clever dialog and description, as you can expect from JD. It discusses world religion, philosophy, the human condition, and somehow manages to be light-hearted and even pretty damn funny at times. Words always seem to get in the way when I want to communicate something but in short, this book was a unique and wonderful experience.",
